        <p>A balanced diet is crucial for providing the body with the necessary nutrients it needs to function correctly. Not only does it contribute to overall health, but it also plays significant roles in disease prevention and maintaining optimal body weight.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Components of a Balanced Diet</h2>
        <p>A balanced diet includes a variety of food items from the following major food groups:</p>
        <ul>
            <ul><strong>Fruits</strong>: Aim for a variety of colors in your fruit choices as different colors typically signify different types of nutrients.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Vegetables</strong>: Like fruits, variety is key. Include dark, leafy greens and bright-colored vegetables to cover a broad spectrum of nutrients.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Whole Grains</strong>: Choose whole grains over refined grains, as they provide more fiber and nutrients. Examples include whole wheat, brown rice, and oats.</li>
            <ul><strong>Proteins</strong>: Focus on lean protein sources such as poultry, fish, beans, and legumes, and occasionally include red meat in moderate amounts.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Dairy</strong>: Opt for low-fat or fat-free dairy options where possible to reduce calorie intake while maintaining nutrient levels.</ul>
            <ul><strong>Fats</strong>: Healthy fats are essential for brain health and energy. Include sources of unsaturated fats like nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil.</ul>
        </ul>
